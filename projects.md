## Experience
+ **NBCUniversal**: 

    + **Sentiment Analysis** Developed a sentiment analysis model using Nielsen Social's Twitter data. The fine-tuned BERT model achieved 80% out-of-sample accuracy and will be deployed to develop the sentiment analysis metric to evaluate social impacts of nominee suggestions for People's Choice Award. 

+ **RubiconMD**: Fully responsible for the development and deployment of a Logistic Regression model to predict medical specialty based on the medical context provided by primary care doctors. The model achieved average out-of-sample AUC score of 0.94 for the top 10 most popular specialties. After the deployment using AWS and Airflow, the model reduces primary care providers' waiting time for  specialist's responses by 25%.


## Projects
+ **[Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/nhungle714/Breast_Cancer_Classification)**: Classified benign vs. malignant breast tumors from mammograms, using transfer learning and deep learning with residual connections. Model achieved average out-of-sample AUC score of 0.85.

+ **[Music Recommender System with Implicit Feedback]**: Used Spark's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method to learn latent factor representations for users and items and tuned the dimension of the latent factors, the regularization parameter, and the scaling parameters. The recommender system on 6 million data points achieved Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of 0.039.

+ **[Avocado Price Forecasting](https://github.com/nhungle714/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Avocado_Prices)**: Forecasted avocado prices in different regions given historical average avocado prices by region and by type (i.e., conventional vs. organic), using Prophet.
